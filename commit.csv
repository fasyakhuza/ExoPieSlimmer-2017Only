syntax, vX.YZ
X, version of the ExoPieTuples. This will change iff when you make major changes in Tuples and hence skimmer need to be changed significantly.
YZ, version of the skimmer. With each time you run the skimmer on the condor you need to send the each detail of change you make in the skimmer  in bullets and we can add a tag for it;
Once you have pushed the code to repository, create a new tag using
, git tag v0.00
, push the new tag using:
, git push origin v0.00

version, description
v0.00, keeping this as the base tag; electron trigger for 2017 has been changed; using the correct definition as per POG

v01.00 , added ak8gen jet;
	, updated b jet regression
	, added trigger and filter for mc;
	, updated Thea correction for 2017 and 18.
	, This is compatible with v01 of tuples for MC (2017)
	, This is compatible with v02 of tuples for Data  (2017)
	,
v01.01  , fix sample name condition for the TTT hadronic and dilepton string; earlier it was by passing these two samples
        , we can save rootfiles in same version as v01.00 as change is minor
	,
v03.02  , applied electron IP cuts
	, this will use the setup_2017_2016_v03 tag of ExoPieElement Tuples
	,
v04.00  , added prefiring weights for 2016 and 2017
	,
v06.00  , added event counter histogram
        , added all the missing variables for 2016
	, this will use most correct variables for the 2017; 2018 [for 2016 there will be another version]
	, this can be used for 2017 data and mc
	,
v06.01 , removed the hightPt trigger for 2016 and 2018
       , for 2017 nothing changes
	,
v06.02 , added Type1Smear MET as the default MET
       , metPhi and MetCorrUnc will be taken from pfmodifiedMetCorrPhi and pfmodifiedMetCorrUnc for 2017
       , kept Type1Smear and Type1Corrected MET in the Skimmed ouput
       , applied met filter in DATA, not in MC
       , recoil or met > 180 and shifting recoil block up after the lepton selection
	,
v06.03 , added hem_veto for 2018
       ,
v06.04 , added Tau21 variable
       , using 2016 function for SDMass correction

v06.05 , using RECO jets for SDMass correction from @Deepak

v06.06 , updated the filter code
       , added calo met and track met variables

       , using 2016 function for SDMass correction

v06.07 , added PUJet IDs
v07.00 , cleaned photon against leptons
       ,
v07.01 , added variables to tag HEM effected events for 2018

v07.02 , updated the name of config dir
	   , defined hem variables as booleans
	,
v07.03 , added "ecalBadCalibReducedMINIAODFilter" in the filter list for 2017 and 2018

v07.04 , using met instead for smear_met for recoil calculation
		, adding support for signal samples
       ,
v07.05 , added uncorr variables for MET_XY(MET_phi) corrections
       ,
v07.06 , using nVtx and changed branch name for MET_XY(MET_phi) corrections
       ,
v12.00 , added JEC sources
       ,
v12.01 , adding Ele115 trigger for 2017, tau pt > 20, type1met,

v12.02 ,  updated pdf and scale weights
